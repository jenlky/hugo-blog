Hi, I'm Jenssen Lee Kang Yuan or jens for short!

I'm a Software Engineer in Singapore who has been programming for over a year 
and graduated from ThoughtWorks Jumpstart, a 3 months coding bootcamp. 
This site contains my writings on technology, software development etc along with my portfolio.

*Why do I want to work with software?* 

Software is eating the world. I want to partake in it because it's where I can maximise impact at scale.
It has a low barrier to entry as with writing. You are a Writer and a Software Developer as long as you make money off it.
I enjoy solving problems and working with individuals dedicated to their craft.

 My email address is <a href="mailto:jenssen.lee@gmail.com">jenssen.lee@gmail.com</a>
