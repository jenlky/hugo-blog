### About Me ###

Hi, I'm Jenssen Lee Kang Yuan or call me Jens!

I'm a Software Engineer in Singapore who has been programming for over a year 
and graduated from ThoughtWorks Jumpstart, a 3 months coding bootcamp. 

I'm currently working at Wen Consulting Pte Ltd where we provide integrated solutions to financial services. Opinions expressed on this site are my own. 

**Why do I want to work with software?**

Software is eating the world. There is a low barrier of entry and gatekeeping to it than say medicine. It affords the freedom to learn on your own like writing. You are a Writer and a Software Developer as long as you make money off it. I chose to join this industry because given my circumstances, it was the best choice for me to make a meaningful impact at scale. 

While I'm optimistic about the power of technology, I'm pessimistic about it as a tool to regulate human's behaviour. When I served in the military, I learnt the efficiacy of peer pressure and social controls when the whole platoon is punished for one person's mistake. The most advanced social technology we have is a village and we've replaced it with monolithic institutions.
