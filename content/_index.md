### About Me ###

Hi, I'm Jenssen Lee Kang Yuan or jens for short!

I'm a Software Engineer in Singapore who has been programming for over a year 
and graduated from ThoughtWorks Jumpstart, a 3 months coding bootcamp. 

I'm now working at a consultancy building websites for financial companies.
This site contains my blog along with my portfolio.

*Why do I want to work with software?* 

Software is eating the world. There is a low barrier to entry to it than say in medicine.
It's the same with writing - you are a Writer and a Software Developer as long as you make money off it.
I choose to participate in it because I believe that's where I can make a meaningful impact at scale.

My email address is <a href="mailto:jenssen.lee@gmail.com">jenssen.lee@gmail.com</a>
