Hi, I'm Jenssen Lee Kang Yuan or jens for short!

I'm a Software Engineer in Singapore who has been programming for over a year 
and just graduated from ThoughtWorks Jumpstart, a 3 months coding bootcamp. 

This site contains my essays on technology, software development and
whatever is on my mind at the moment. The projects page holds a
portfolio of my projects.

I code because software is eating the world and I want to partake in
it. I enjoy solving problems and working with individuals dedicated to
their craft.
