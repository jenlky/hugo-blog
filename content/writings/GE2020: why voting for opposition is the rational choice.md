This is a response to my friend's blog post on [Why All Singaporean Voters Should Support the Ruling PAP](https://yeokhengmeng.com/2020/07/why-all-singaporean-voters-should-support-the-ruling-pap/):

> "In my view, if we want to elect an alternative, they must bring something significantly different and better to the table."
Why must it be "significantly different"? I think it's okay to be similar, or half a step left, as long as it helps the citizens. Jamus mentioned for every dollar Singapore workers received an insufficient amount of 42 cents compared to 55 cents in Japan. That seems fair enough to me ðŸ¤”
"The PAP has been accused of parachuting candidates from the military and civil service. Is the WP totally different in this aspect? WPâ€™s representative in that debate Jamus Lim seems just as parachuted based on his high qualifications."

I think you have taken that idea out of context. Usually, it's meant to describe the phenomenon whereby PAP take paper generals and groom them as ministers. These people who have no relevant industrial experience in that field will be given rein to take charge of it. That's what people are upset about.
The thing is WP is not in power, whoever they field doesn't affect us unless the said person is voted into the parliament. Even then, I doubt they can do much since the opposition only occupies less than 10% of the parliament seats.

**Freak election (quotes below are from Singapore, Incomplete by Cherian George)**

> "We neednâ€™t fear that the double standard will result in a low-quality opposition party ultimately winning power. Singaporeans will be sensible enough to recalibrate their expectations when the opposition grows larger. Assuming its size and quality remains at current levels, Iâ€™d expect an equilibrium to be reached when the opposition secures around 20 seats."

Among all the opposition parties, I think we should take WP seriously given their accomplishments; the others are not going to make much headway imo. They're only contesting 4 GRCs and 2 SMCs, if by sheer luck they won all that they contested - highly improbable - they will only win 21 seats! Take 22/93 and that's 22.58% - not even 1/3!!

> "A public that took 32 years to grow the number of elected opposition MPs from one to seven can hardly be described as cavalier risk-takers. But it serves the ruling partyâ€™s interests to convince Singaporeans that they cannot trust their fellow citizens to vote in a sober manner. The myth of the irrational voter continues to be rehashed before every election"

I haven't checked the numbers but that looks accurate given my understanding. Unless Singaporeans all vote for Chee Soon Juan and Tan Cheng Bock's party which is highly doubtful. Then again, you could mention it being a black swan event. I get it, there's no easy way to work around this game theory.
I'm not sure about NCMPs so I won't comment on it. They would rather risk and sacrifice their lives and privacy by choosing to remain in opposition than choose to be NCMPs, so I'm fairly certain there's good reason why they're rejecting it. And I don't think it is out of spite or self-interest (who would join opposition for self-interest right ha ha ha).

End. 

In my opinion, there are many signs of ongoing political decay. Firstly, I can't believe that none of the ministers, who are probably more well-educated than you and me, foresee the situation at the dormitory as a ticking time bomb. That's obvious negligence. "Oh well, it's fine right since local cases were controlled." "Hmm guess what, they're now owning their mistake and building a better quality and more spacious dormitory.""

Secondly, what happened with Oxley road is very suspicious. PM Lee's siblings were criticising him and people were saying "it's just another family squabble". This is not just any other family, their squabble creates a ripple in Singapore that has far-reaching effects.

Thirdly, MRT should be nationalised. Why are we privatising profits and socialising costs? Look I, and many Singaporeans, wouldn't be complaining if there are alternative transport solutions. Why is it failing now? What does that say about the management? Poor planning, poor foresight? Did the profit go into the shareholders pocket and they spend adequately on maintenance/repairs?

I can go on and on but I want to say it's that elitist mindset of I know better than you and uncompassionate stance that irks me. As long as they have more than 2/3 of the seats, we'll be forced to deal with it. Given the first-past-the-post system, the day when PAP loses 1/2 seats is the day when we have bigger problems than them losing. Who knows how bad things will be in the country by then.
