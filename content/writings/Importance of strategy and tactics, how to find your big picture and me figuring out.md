"Personal motivation structure" is like the tactics in service of the strategic doing of what resonates with you. Tactics are the actual means to achieve a short-term goal. Strategy, on the other hand, is the overarching plan to achieve long-term goals. You can't do without either of them. If you don't have a concrete plan, you won't be able to achieve anything. If you don't have a big picture, you'll be bogged down by inflexible, expired plans. 

What should inform your big picture then? A number of things: focusing is an excellent north star guide to determining what resonates with you. That often involves a lot of journaling and looking into your past: what excited you as a kid? What issues bothered you? How was your relationship with your family/caregivers and friends? With school, studies and work? What hangups did you have? What were your idiosyncrasies? The older I get, the more I believe `"we just need to stop self-sabotaging ourselves"`. That requires us to unlearn old habits, learn new patterns of behaviour and relearn our existing ideas. 

It's very easy to default to watching TV shows or idly scrolling *social media/youtube/reddit* when you have nothing to do. It's not particularly fun or boring (it can be), it's just meh. I myself am guilty of that recently when I was watching Avatar: The Last Airbender (ATLA) and idly scrolling manga subreddit. That one night of binge reading Gunka no Balzar brought back nostalgia to how I've been spending my time for a long long time. It's not meaningful in any way but it's comfortable like an old friend. I didn't feel excited reading it, but neither was I really bored. It did not spark joy or excitement, I was just letting it pass through me - I wonder what this phenomenon is called.

I'm thinking if I have to tighten my emotional feedback loop. It feels like I'm taking too long to make adjustments. I have no idea how I'm going to do it except bringing back attention to focus on understanding my emotions more often. This afternoon I stopped watching ATLA after a while to write. However, I didn't feel inspired and couldn't get into it; that led to more distractions. The problem is my Notion note is too messy and full of many different ideas. What I can do is list the top few most urgent writing prompt and pick one from them. Next I can and should create a clean slate note for it.
